## Expected and observed

| Arm | Activation expected | Activation observed | Tools | Completion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| treatment | false | false | 0 | 0 |
| baseline | false | false | 0 | 0 |

Treatment: 1 response lines; changed files `.cache/npm/_logs/2026-11-09T04_55_56_044Z-debug-0.log`; removed files `none`; validation command present: `requires review`. Workflow cost: 3.399 seconds and 0 tool calls; token usage is in the JSON record.

Baseline: 1 response lines; changed files `.cache/npm/_logs/2026-11-09T04_55_59_504Z-debug-0.log`; removed files `none`; validation command present: `requires review`. Workflow cost: 4.581 seconds and 0 tool calls; token usage is in the JSON record.


Expected deliverable: Expect: a short factual answer without a repository trace.

Deliverable correctness and unnecessary workflow cost require review of each response and artifact. The JSON record separates these judgments from activation detection and records usage, elapsed time, response lines, and changed files.

## Isolation evidence

The first arm's sentinel was absent from the second arm: `True`. Restored file inodes are separate. Each arm's input manifest is checked again immediately before its model call.

Project candidate copies are excluded from both restored fixtures; only the treatment receives a candidate copy. The manifest lists every excluded project path and its hash. Dependencies are installed in both temporary homes.
