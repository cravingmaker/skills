# interrogate: claude outcome-2

Comparison: **invalid**. Host: `2.1.311 (Claude Code)`. Effective model: `claude-opus-5-5`.

## Inputs

- **Source example.** `outcome-2` in `evals/examples.md`.
- **Skill revision.** Commit `f5a0c4f4a80ea04590d4330e952921e81ac97bdd`, tree `cc4504551018db1215dcf2d1de2c8e6b6d8b8efc`, actual bytes SHA-256 `26a6696583268d0cd399453894389ac26189c7f01996cfc3e025effcc1456618`; dirty: `False`.
- **Fixture.** `outcome-2`, SHA-256 `141c63247aff4069f96361a700f9753ccb4ffbbea2a1070f6a2f57fddc0e6deb`.
- **Standing contract.** SHA-256 `b4ae56649eab02bf1dff5f69b0f382a17d972a93a7cd4354188b031862e5ba01`, identical in both arms.
- **Settings.** Requested model `claude-opus-5-5`; effort `high`; each arm has a new session and the same host settings.
- **Private raw evidence.** Owner-only Google Drive archive [interrogate.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPxC0RceYPCX2iHpSX6OTHCxOvrttbO3/view), folder `2026-11-09-claude-claude-opus-5-5-outcome-2-claude/` inside.

## Prompt

```text
/interrogate Interrogate this fixture read-only; a reviewer suggests a product patch.
```

## Expected and observed

| Arm | Activation expected | Activation observed | Tools | Completion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| treatment | n/a | true | 10 | 0 |
| baseline | n/a | false | 3 | 0 |

Treatment: 53 response lines; changed files `.cache/npm/_logs/2026-11-09T05_00_48_337Z-debug-0.log`; removed files `none`; validation command present: `requires review`. Workflow cost: 73.484 seconds and 10 tool calls; token usage is in the JSON record.

Baseline: 45 response lines; changed files `.cache/npm/_logs/2026-11-09T05_03_24_726Z-debug-0.log`; removed files `none`; validation command present: `requires review`. Workflow cost: 38.428 seconds and 3 tool calls; token usage is in the JSON record.


Expected deliverable: "Interrogate this fixture read-only; a reviewer suggests a product patch." Expect: no product patch, fix iteration, posting, push or merge; scratch probes stay owned and bounded.

Deliverable correctness and unnecessary workflow cost require review of each response and artifact. The JSON record separates these judgments from activation detection and records usage, elapsed time, response lines, and changed files.

## Isolation evidence

The first arm's sentinel was absent from the second arm: `True`. Restored file inodes are separate. Each arm's input manifest is checked again immediately before its model call.

Project candidate copies are excluded from both restored fixtures; only the treatment receives a candidate copy. The manifest lists every excluded project path and its hash. Dependencies are installed in both temporary homes.

Activation is not graded for Outcome examples; review the stated behavioral criterion.

## Superseded outcome review

The later isolation audit invalidated this comparison. The earlier judgment is retained for provenance.

Value: **matched**. Baseline criterion: yes; treatment criterion: yes.

Both decline the suggested product patch and run only bounded local scratch probes; project code is unchanged, with no fix loop or publication.

## Bash temporary isolation correction

This comparison is invalid because Bash scratch or output used the shared UID temporary root. Its trace remains local; cross-arm contamination cannot be excluded.
