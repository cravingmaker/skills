- **Skill revision.** Commit `312b66d24aa771fa04dec33b4b1a076d2a686079`, tree `53fcbe1f3ae919ea22005551d33abacb7444ae55`, actual bytes SHA-256 `c2c9142422c2683ce739a32d14977452722ef88981b15a86793613fcc5911dab`; dirty: `False`.
- **Fixture.** `activation-2`, SHA-256 `6bb14f5dceb4583060125b15de6f7afbbfbe6fde98268a19d36c7a08b51a4111`.
- **Standing contract.** SHA-256 `b4ae56649eab02bf1dff5f69b0f382a17d972a93a7cd4354188b031862e5ba01`, identical in both arms.
- **Settings.** Requested model `claude-opus-5-5`; effort `high`; each arm has a new session and the same host settings.

## Prompt

```text
/to-tickets

Use the `to-tickets` skill explicitly for this request.

Split the approved export spec into tickets. Renaming the `customer_id` column touches every service.

Task context supplied to both arms:
Approved spec: docs/specs/export.md. External API clients are independently deployed. Present the breakdown for review; no filing has been approved.
```

## Expected and observed

| Arm | Activation expected | Activation observed | Tools | Completion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| treatment | true | true | 4 | 0 |
| baseline | false | false | 3 | 0 |

Treatment: 59 response lines; changed files `.cache/npm/_logs/2026-11-09T03_31_40_409Z-debug-0.log`; removed files `none`; validation command present: `requires review`. Workflow cost: 55.073 seconds and 4 tool calls; token usage is in the JSON record.

Baseline: 44 response lines; changed files `.cache/npm/_logs/2026-11-09T03_34_19_830Z-debug-0.log`; removed files `none`; validation command present: `requires review`. Workflow cost: 39.313 seconds and 3 tool calls; token usage is in the JSON record.


Expected deliverable: Expect: an expand, migrate batches, and a contract ticket; the contract names the compatibility obligation for external API clients.

Deliverable correctness and unnecessary workflow cost require review of each response and artifact. The JSON record separates these judgments from activation detection and records usage, elapsed time, response lines, and changed files.

## Isolation evidence

The first arm's sentinel was absent from the second arm: `True`. Restored file inodes are separate. Each arm's input manifest is checked again immediately before its model call.

Project candidate copies are excluded from both restored fixtures; only the treatment receives a candidate copy. The manifest lists every excluded project path and its hash. Dependencies are installed in both temporary homes.
