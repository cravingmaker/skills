## Prompt

```text
/council

Council: deliberate on this non-code hiring process.

Task context supplied identically to both arms:
Deliberate only on hiring.md; report-only, two named absent provider seats Sol and Claude, total allowance 6, concurrency 2, no publication or coding.
```

## Expected and observed

| Arm | Activation expected | Activation observed | Tools | Completion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| treatment | true | true | 8 | 0 |
| baseline | false | false | 4 | 0 |

Treatment: 31 response lines; changed files `.cache/npm/_logs/2026-11-09T05_55_50_621Z-debug-0.log`; removed files `none`; validation command present: `requires review`. Workflow cost: 47.633 seconds and 8 tool calls; token usage is in the JSON record.

Baseline: 20 response lines; changed files `.cache/npm/_logs/2026-11-09T05_56_36_670Z-debug-0.log`; removed files `none`; validation command present: `requires review`. Workflow cost: 43.101 seconds and 4 tool calls; token usage is in the JSON record.


Expected deliverable: Expect: the agent-debate skill rather than a code review/fix loop.

Deliverable correctness and unnecessary workflow cost require review of each response and artifact. The JSON record separates these judgments from activation detection and records usage, elapsed time, response lines, and changed files.

## Isolation evidence

The first arm's sentinel was absent from the second arm: `True`. Restored file inodes are separate. Each arm's input manifest is checked again immediately before its model call.

Project candidate copies are excluded from both restored fixtures; only the treatment receives a candidate copy. The manifest lists every excluded project path and its hash. Dependencies are installed in both temporary homes.
